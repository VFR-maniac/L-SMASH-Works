[lwinput.aui: L-SMASH Works File Reader]
    [Settings]
        You can open the settings dialog by "File" -> "General settings" -> "Input plugins configure" -> "L-SMASH Works File Reader".
        [File readers]
            L-SMASH Works File Reader tries in order of "Libav+L-SMASH" -> "AviSynth Script" -> "LW-Libav".
            + Libav+L-SMASH   : check box (default : checked)
                Enable a reader by libavcodec as decoder and L-SMASH as demuxer if checked.
            + AviSynth Script : check box (default : checked)
                Enable a reader for AviSynth Script files (*.avs) if checked.
            + LW-Libav        : check box (default : checked)
                Enable a reader by libavcodec as decoder and libavformat as demuxer if checked.
        [Decoders]
            Libav+L-SMASH and LW-Libav use libavcodec as a decoder.
            The following settings affect these readers.
            + threads : up-down control (default : 0)
                The number of threads to decode a stream by libavcodec.
                The value 0 means the number of threads is determined automatically and then the maximum value is up to 16.
            + Forward threshold : up-down control (default : 10)
                The threshold to decide whether a decoding starts from the closest RAP to get the requested video frame or doesn't.
                    * RAP is an abbreviation of random accessible point.
                Let's say
                  - the threshold is T,
                and
                  - you request to seek the M-th frame called f(M) from the N-th frame called f(N).
                If M > N and M - N <= T, then
                    the decoder tries to get f(M) by decoding frames from f(N) sequentially.
                If M < N or M - N > T, then
                    check the closest RAP at the first.
                    After the check, if the closest RAP is identical with the last RAP, do the same as the case M > N and M - N <= T.
                    Otherwise, the decoder tries to get f(M) by decoding frames from the frame which is the closest RAP sequentially.
            + Seek mode : combo box (default : Normal)
                How to process when any error occurs during decoding a video frame.
                    - Normal
                        This mode retries sequential decoding from the next closest RAP up to 3 cycles when any decoding error occurs.
                        If all 3 trial failed, retry sequential decoding from the last RAP by ignoring trivial errors.
                        Still error occurs, then return the last returned frame to postprocessors.
                    - Unsafe
                        This mode retries sequential decoding from the next closest RAP up to 3 cycles when any fatal decoding error occurs.
                        If all 3 trial failed, then return the last returned frame to postprocessors.
                    - Aggressive
                        This mode returns the last returned frame to postprocessors when any fatal decoding error occurs.
        [Video postprocessors]
            + Video scaler : combo box (default : Fast bilinear)
                The scaling algorithm for chroma upsamling.
                This settings is applied for progressive or non-YUV4:2:0 frames.
                For interlaced YUV4:2:0 frames, apply 5-3-7-1 interlaced YUV4:2:0 interpolation based on MPEG-2 Video chroma location.
        [Audio postprocessors]
            + Audio delay : edit box (default : 0)
                Amount of audio delay relative to video stream in units of the number of PCM samples.
                Positive value means audio is delayed from the original and soundless PCM samples are inserted to the start.
                Negative value means audio is advanced from the original and the first samples are removed by the specified value.
            + Sampling rate : edit box (default : 0)
                Audio sampling rate or sampling frequency in units of Hz.
                The value 0 means audio stream is output to the buffer from the decoder via the resampler at the maximum sampling rate in audio stream.
                Otherwise, audio stream is output to the buffer from the decoder via the resampler at specified sampling rate.
            + Channel layout : edit box (default : Unspecified)
                Output audio channel layout.
                If unspecified, audio stream is output to the buffer from the decoder via the resampler at the channel layout
                which is the first maximum number of channels in audio stream.
                You can specify channel layout by combination of the name of a channel layout with separator (+) as follows.
                    - the name or mask of a single channel.

            + Mix level : slider control
                Audio mixing level multipliers.
                0.71 is identical with sqrt(1/2) (i.e. 0.707106781186547524401).
                    - Center   (default : 0.71)
                    - Surround (default : 0.71)
                    - LFE      (default : 0.00)
            + A/V sync correction : check box (default : checked)
                Try Audio/Visual synchronization at the first video frame if checked.
        [LW-Libav specific]
            + Create Index file : check box (default : checked)
                Create the index file (.lwi) to the same directory as the input file if checked.
                The index file avoids parsing all frames in the input file at the next or later access.
                Parsing all frames is very important for frame accurate seek.
            + Libav video index : check box (default : unchecked) / edit box (default : -1)
                Try to activate a video stream specified if checked.
                The value -1 deactivates any video stream.
                If unchecked, try to activate a video stream which has the largest resolution.
            + Libav audio index : check box (default : unchecked) / edit box (default : -1)
                Try to activate a audio stream specified if checked.
                The value -1 deactivates any audio stream.
                If unchecked, try to activate the first detected audio stream.
            + Apply repeat flag : check box (default : unchecked)
                Reconstruct frames by the flags specified in video stream and then treat all frames as interlaced if checked and usable.
                If unchecked, video frames consisting of two separated field coded pictures are displayed twice consecutively.
            + Field dominance : combo box (default : Top -> Bottom)
                Which field, top or bottom, is displayed first.
                This settings is enabled only if Apply repeat flag is checked.
        [Dummy reader]
            Dummy reader is used when deactivating video stream or the input file has no video stream
            since AviUtl can't handle any input file without video stream.
            + Dummy resolution : edit box (default : 720 x 480 )
                A resolution (width x height) of dummy video stream.
            + Dummy framerate  : edit box (default : 24 / 1 )
                A framerate (numerator / denominator at frames per second) of dummy video stream.
                Larger framerate helps more sample accurate editing.
            + Dummy colorspace : combo box (default : YUY2)
                A colorspace of dummy video stream.
